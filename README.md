# Sheep Tilt Maze - Unity 3D Game

## Overview
Sheep Tilt Maze is a 3D Unity game created as part of a two-week school coursework project. In this game, you control a sheep navigating a tilt maze, collecting coins while avoiding monsters. The entire game world is physics-based, with all objects rolling in the same direction based on the maze's tilt.

## Features
- **Tilt-Based Movement**: Control the entire maze by tilting it, causing all objects to roll simultaneously.
- **Collectibles**: Gather coins scattered throughout the maze to increase your score.
- **Avoid Monsters**: Stay away from rolling enemies that chase you or obstruct your path.
- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Every object in the game behaves like a sphere, rolling naturally in response to tilting.
- **Time-Limited Challenge**: Complete the level before time runs out to maximize your score.

## Controls
- **Tilt the Maze**: Use arrow keys to rotate the maze and influence the movement of all objects.

## Installation & Running the Game
1. Ensure you have **Unity** installed (if running from source).
2. Download or clone the project repository.
3. Open the project in Unity.
4. Press `Play` in the Unity Editor, or build and run the game.

## Development Tools
- **Engine**: Unity (C# scripting)
- **Physics**: Unity's Rigidbody physics system
- **3D Models**: Unity primitives and/or imported assets
- **UI**: Basic game UI with sound effects for interactions

## Future Improvements
- Ways to exit the game
- Power-ups to enhance gameplay (e.g., speed boosts, temporary invincibility)
- Multiplayer or leaderboard functionality
